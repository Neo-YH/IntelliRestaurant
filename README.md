# IntelliRestaurant

The Internet has brought more and more business opportunities and made our life convenient. Many years ago, there was no Meituan, AliPay, WechatPay. Most people have no idea about booking a taxi by their mobile phone and engaging in online payment.

At that time, I always wanted to make a software to help students memorize English words. But I am not able to do it at that time. Until many years later, I saw excellent softwares such as 100 Word Chopping and Shell. At that time, I chose to learn programming. However, even today, I'm still a rookie. So I want to open source all my ideas. Sounds ridiculous, ha? What if someone really realizes it in the future, or I have the opportunity to participate in it, this page can be a witness of the story.

IntelliRestaurant is one of the ideas, it can be a restaurant or a mini app. When you book a meal or add a cup of juice in the app, the ingradients such as protein will be accumulated in the app and visualize the levels of each ingradients with a dynamic graph.

So I write a simple demo, and it can calculate the protein of a cup of honey lemonade. It is too ruimentary that you can not use it to do much things with the it. And I got some information from this webpage:

All in all, at least I had a try. I don't want to blame myself because nothing has been done. Hope this page will be updated in the near future.
