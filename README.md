# IntelliRestaurant

The Internet has brought more and more business opportunities and convenient life. Many years ago, there was no Meituan, booking a taxi by your mobile phone or online payment were not easy to reach.

Many years ago, I always wanted to make a word memory software, but I didn't have this ability. Until many years later, I saw excellent software such as 100 Word Chopping, Shell and so on. That's why I chose to learn programming, but today, I'm still a rookie. So I want to open source all my ideas, sounds ridiculous, ha? What if someone really realizes it in the future, or I have the opportunity to participate in it, I will become a lucky ... lucky rookie.

IntelliRestaurant is one of the ideas, it can be a restaurant or a mini app. When you book a meal or add a cup of juice in the ordering procedure. The ingradients such as protein will be accumulated in the app and visualize the levels of each ingradients with a dynamic graph.

So I write a simple demo, and it can calculate the protein of a cup of honey lemonade. It is too ruimentary that you can not use it to do much things with the it. And I got some information from this webpage:

All in all, at least I did it. I don't want to blame myself because nothing has been done. Hope this page will be updated in the near future.
